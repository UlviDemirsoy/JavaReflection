# Frontend – Vue 3, Tailwind CSS, shadcn-vue

The frontend is built with Vue 3 using the Composition API. Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS, providing a clean and responsive design.
We use shadcn-vue for accessible, customizable UI components like modals, forms, and tooltips — enabling fast and consistent interface development.
